/*
First exercise from Eloquent JavaScript.

Challenge was to write a script that produces
a triangle of hash marks.
*/

//Variables
var hashTotal = "#";     //Create a hash mark variable
var nextHash = "#";      //Create a var to hold the additional hash marks

//Set a loop to run 7 times
for (let i = 0; i < 7 ; i++){
    //Display the hash
    console.log(hashTotal);
    //Add an additional hashmark to hash
    hashTotal = nextHash + hashTotal;
}
